##Once you have data installed and a package for visualizing your data, you can create graphs. This example will generate a plot graph using the 
palmer penguins dataset previously detailed.##

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))

##If you want to add a title, a sub-title, or caption to your graph, you can do so like this:##

ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))+
labs(title="Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs. Flipper Length", subtitle="Sample of Three Penguin Species")+
caption="Data collected by Dr. Kristen Gorman")

##if you need to annotate the graph, you can do so by adding the following to the above:##

+
annotate("text", x=220,y=3500,label=2The Gentoos are the largest")



##If the code is getting a bit long, you can save the plot as a variable by doing the following:##

p<- ggplot(data = penguins) + geom_point(mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g))+
labs(title="Palmer Penguins: Body Mass vs. Flipper Length", subtitle="Sample of Three Penguin Species")



##This way, when you want to add anything new, you only have to add a +. For example##

p+annotate("text", x=220,y=3500,label=2The Gentoos are the largest")
