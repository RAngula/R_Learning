##Facetting your data in R allows you to partition a plot into a matrix of panels. Perhaps you want to answer a specific question by comparing different variables
across your data. This is where fascets come in. 

Using the same penguin dataset as mentioned previously, this is how you might create a scattergraph while incuding a facet##

ggplot(data=penguins)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm,y=body_mass_g,color=species))+
facet_wrap(~species)

##for multiple variables, use facet_grid##

ggplot(data=penguins)+
geom_point(mapping=aes(x=flipper_length_mm,y=body_mass_g,color=species))+
facet_grid(sex~species)

##By playing around with different variations of facets, you can discover new relationships in your data and really understand the variables.##
