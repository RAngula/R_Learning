##For this example, we will be installing the visualization package: 'ggplot2' ((grammar of graphics) which can be used to visualize your data), and
an example dataset "Palmer Penguins". We will also need to install another package, "Tidyverse" which contains ggplot2 as part of the package.

First the packages need to be installed##

install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")

##Once these packages have been installed, they need to be loaded:##

library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
